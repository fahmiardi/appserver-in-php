AppServer, a set of components for building fast universal web-apps in PHP
==========================================================================

[![Latest Stable Version](https://poser.pugx.org/aip/aip/v/stable.png)](https://packagist.org/packages/aip/aip)

Web server interface for PHP, inspired by Ruby’s [Rack](http://rack.github.io/) and
Python’s [WSGI](http://wsgi.readthedocs.org/). It provides a common API for connecting
PHP frameworks and applications to webservers.

The main idea is, that your app, if built for this protocol, will be able to 
preload resources, preconnect to databases and response to requests **really** fast.

PHP 5.3+ is required, as it provides [garbage collector](http://docs.php.net/gc) for cyclic references,
which is critical for long-running apps.

## Installation

The recommended way to install AiP is [through Composer](http://getcomposer.org). 
Just create a `composer.json` file and run the `php composer.phar install` command to install it:

    {
        "require": {
            "aip/aip": "~0.10.0"
        }
    }

## Usage

Take a look at [example](https://github.com/indeyets/appserver-in-php/tree/master/examples/new/).

* MyApp.class.php — application class. "__invoke()" method is the entry point
* aip.yaml — defines that this application should be served both as HTTP and SCGI

run with `aip app [path/to/[aip.yaml]]` command, test by pointing your browser to http://127.0.0.1:8080/
